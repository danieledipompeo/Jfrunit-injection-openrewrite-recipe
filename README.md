# JfrUnit-injection-openrewrite-recipe
this repository aims to create an openrewrite recipe to inject JUnit into already existing JUnit unit tests in Java projects.

### [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/)
JUnit is testing framework devoted to develop tests in Java

### [Java Flight Recorder (JFR)](https://docs.oracle.com/javacomponents/jmc-5-4/jfr-runtime-guide/about.htm#JFRUH170)
JFR is profiling tool devoted to collect all the events generated by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) during the execution.

### [JfrUnit](https://github.com/moditect/jfrunit)
JfrUnit is a JUnit extension that allows to start a JFR recording during the execution of a JUnit test and eventually doing some assertions on JFR events.

The target of this project is to inject all the JfrUnit code to start a JFR recording during the JUnit tests execution by using openrewrite, a refactoring library.
This project is made up of two refactoring recipies:
- **michele-JfrUnit**: this recipe aims to add the JfrUnit stuff like annotations, statements, etc necessary to start a JFR recording.
- **completeJfrUnitWorkflow**: this recipe aims to refactor a generic project in a way that allows to inject JfrUnit (e.g.: add JfrUnit dependency, etc...).
